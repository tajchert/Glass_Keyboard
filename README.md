Google Glass Keyboard
============
App for Google Glass that allows you to input digits and letters, simple as that. Select them byhead movement, and tap to make a choice.

###Details
App isn't yet in stable release, I will finish it in few hours (I need some sleep).

###Final note
There is many possibilities to make this software better, but I wrote this as a fun with borrowed Google Glass'es, so I'm not being able to do so. I encourage you to fork, add new features and create pull request.
