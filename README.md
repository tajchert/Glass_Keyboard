Google Glass NumPad
============
App for Google Glass that allows you to input digits, simple as that. Select digit by moving your head horizontally, and tap to make a choice.

###Use of an app
In ```Tools``` class you will find ```inputLength``` that defines how many digits should user select before terminating Activity. Also in ```Tools``` there is ```saved``` parameter which is String of digits so far selected.


Selecting digit, one that is upsized is going to be selected when user taps Glasses. On the top there is ```TextView``` that shows digits selected so far (```X``` is for empty selection).

###Final note
There is many possibilities to make this software better, but I wrote this as a fun with borrowed Google Glass'es, so I'm not being able to do so. I encourage you to fork, add new features and create pull request.
